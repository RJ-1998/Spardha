    <li>A foul made on a player attempting a shot results in the awarding of the same number of free-throws as those of the shot taken (two from inside the arc, three from outside). If a player is fouled but makes the attempted shot, the shot counts and an additional free-throw will be awarded.
    </li>
    <li>Once a team has made four fouls in a period, each additional foul (on a player not attempting a shot) will result in the automatic awarding of two free-throws.</li>

                            <li> The shot must be placed close to the neck and resting on the shoulder, while keeping it in that position the entire time until it is released. No padding or extra equipment is necessary </li>

                            <li>No part of the athlete's foot should cross the front edge of the foul line. If, at the point of take-off, any part of his foot (even the toe edge of his shoe) crosses the front edge of the foul line, then the jump is termed to be illegal or a 'foul jump', and does not count. </li>
                            <li>Typically, in International track and field events, a long jumper has three attempts to register his or her best legal jump. A foul jump accounts for an attempt, but the time isn't registered. Only the farthest legal jump counts. </li>
                            <li>The distance, or the 'jump' is measured from the front edge of the foul line to the first landing point of the athlete. To better understand this, consider an athlete taking off legally from the foul line and landing on his feet 15 ft from the foul line. However, if, while landing, his hands touch the ground before his legs and a foot behind his farthest landing point, he would be awarded a jump of 14 ft, since the hands are nearer to the foul line than the feet and are the first point of contact.</li>
                            <li>Similarly, even if the athlete takes off from behind the foul line, the starting point is still considered to be the front edge of the foul line, rather than the athlete's actual point of take off.</li>
                            <li>Somersaults are not permitted during the jump. </li>
                            <li>The maximum allowed thickness for a long jumper's shoe sole is 13 mm. </li>
                            <li>Records made with the assistance of a tailwind of more than 2 m/s are not considered. However, the time is registered in the ongoing competition, since all the athletes benefit from the same wind conditions.</li>

                            <li><u>Start:-</u>Every 100-meter sprinter must begin the race with his feet in the starting blocks. The official race starter will call the sprinters to their blocks and on command the runners will adopt a set position. The set position requires the runners to have both feet in the blocks and adopt a position with the body weight on their hands. On the starter's gun all runners begin the race.</li>
                            <li><u>False Start:-</u>A false start is called when the feet of a runner leave the starting blocks before the starter’s gun. </li>
                            <li><u>Lanes:-</u>Any 100-meter sprinter who leaves his/her lane or obstructs the path of another sprinter will be automatically disqualified from the race. Stepping on the white lines is ruled as having left your lane during the race. In these circumstances, the race referee can order the race to be run over again if it is deemed necessary.</li>
                            <li><u>Finish:-</u>The finish is the decisive stage of the race, and is very exciting when sprinters are close to each other in terms of ability. The IAAF rules state that the time of a runner is recorded when the trunk of the body crosses the finish line. Times are recorded and reported to .01 seconds.</li>
